		<p>Our used steper motors, which should turn the joints only rely on 28 Nanometer torque. We did not wanted to increase the size too much.  Therefore we wanted to increase power without increasing weight on top of the arm with a stronger but heavier motor.

		<p>What we decided to make use of is a mechanism that will increase torque and by the way decrease speed.
		<br>
		We come from a small gear of 18mm diameter to a bigger one of 64mm and hoped it would be strong enough.
		<br>
		These parts will be printed with a 0.4mm Nozzle to have a sufficient result.

		<p>in the middle of the two big gears we will insert a 14mm Ball Bearing which will ride on an 8mm shaft

		<p>To hold the shaft and also the motors, I made two houses which are individually designed and fit perfectly with the specific parts
		<br>
		on the top part is space for the same Ball Bearings, which are inserted into the gears
