    <h3>3D-modelling my own kitchen accessories</h3>
    <p>I needed to have a sieve, but i do not wanted to go to a shop to buy one myself, so i decided to print it by my own. I used the software Fusion 360 which is available in a free-student-licence.</p>
    
    <table>
    <td><img src="images/L3/Screenshot1.png" height="300px">
    I first builded a vertical line (50mmm) together with a bow (50mm) and another horizontal line (50mm) and used the button for <code>turning</code> to build a bowl with a flat bottom (because the sieve should stnd by itself).   
    </td>
        
    <td><img src="images/L3/Screenshot2.png" height="300px">
    Than I wanted to extrude holes into the bottom, beaucse a sieve should let go the liquid *obious*. I started with a small hole in the middle.
    </td>
        
    <td><img src="images/L3/Screenshot3.png" height="300px">
    Than I used the <code>rectangular-array</code> to copy the hole to an amount of 400 (10 in each direction with a distance of 5mm between each hole).
    </td>
    </table>
    
    <table>
    <td><img src="images/L3/Screenshot4.png" height="300px">
    </td>
    <td VALIGN="middle">The sieve also should have a nice handle. I first made a scetch on the top which consists of a triangle and in the one edge i made a bow and extruded the surface till the bottom of the whole sieve. To extrude the handle particularily I made a scetch on the front surface (blue line).
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/L3/Screenshot5.png" height="300px">
    At least, extruded the surface of the handle.
    </td>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Problems I faced</h3>
    It was a bit hard build the handle. The problem I was face with is that the sieve is has a round shape and therefor I had to do the scetch fitting to my bowl, otherwise i would cut of a straight line through the bowl.
