                <p>
                    In this week Iam gonna build something big with a CNC Mill. We have a 2.50*1.25 big sheet of Playwood and can build everything we want, as far as it is possible to stand without any glue (so it each shape has to fit into the other). <br> In my case, I wanted to build a Desk for the Bed. <br> Me and my girlfriend love to eat in bed on sunday mornings and even at evening it sometimes is very cosy to just eat diner while watching TV series. This desk cold also be used for holding the screen either while bathing or also in bed. It should contain 2 drinkholders which go inside the desk.
