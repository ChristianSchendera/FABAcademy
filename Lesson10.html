                <li>Design a 3D mould around the stock and tooling that you'll be using, mill it (rough cut + (at least) three-axis finish cut), and use it to cast parts.</li>

           <li>Explained how you designed your 3D mould and created your rough and finish toolpaths for machining</li>
            <li>Shown how you made your mould and cast the parts</li>
            <li>Described problems and how you fixed them</li>
            <li>Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the mould and the final object</li>
            <li>Reviewed the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then made and compared test casts with each of them</li>
