    <ul><h3>modelling</h3>
    
<table>
    <h3>manual approach</h3>
    <td><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot1.png" width="100%">
    First build a rectangle and insert 4 small rectangle on every side. Than trimmed the unneeded lines.
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot4.png" width="100%">
    Same with a triangular and a circle. For both I had to use small rectangles with fixation on 3 points to build it in a right angle and also trimmed out the unneeded lines.
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot5.png" width="100%">
    I used command in the scetchpallette to make all lines equal, so a bigger rectangle on one drawing will automatically change all others, too. In case i change the thickness of the material for example.
    </td>
</table>
        
    <h2>v.s.</h2>
        
<table>
    
    <h3>Parameter approach</h3>
    
    <td><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot6.png" width="100%">   
    here I can determine values for individual purposes. Just click on the + and type in the value and the name for it. In example "thickness".
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot7.png" width="100%">
    Now, when you press "D" or right click and press <code>Sketch measurement</code>, than you can define the size.
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot8.png" width="100%">
    Instead of typing numbers, you can now define by the specific name you gave to the value, like here "thickness"
    </td>
</table>
<table>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot9.png" width="100%">
    As you see, the thickness now changed to 5mm automatically.
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot10.png" width="100%">
    You can do that for every purpose you like. I also defined the length of the sides next to my cutoffs (10mm).
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Screenshot11.png" width="100%">
    Now if you use a different material it is easy to change the sizes of all drawings by simple using the parameter and changing the values as you like. I now wanted to have a 10mm thick material and the sidelength should be 40mm.
    </td>
</table>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Note:</h3>
Even if you use the parameter to define your values, it is inevitable to use the tool for making lines equal to each other. Or for the triangular to make the cut-off-lines coinzident to the outside-line.

    <ul>
<h3>Cutting</h3>
    <p>When you exported your sketch as an .dxf file, drag it on a USB stick and drop it on the Computer of the Laser Cutter
    </p>
    
<table>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Bild1.png" width="100%">
    For dublicating and printing I use Rhino(ceros). First I dublicated each shape 8 times and grouped them together for less material waste.
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Bild2.png" width="100%">
    Because I don't know exactly wich instructions to set, i wanted to make a test.<br>For that, I made 3 rectangles and colored them differently, so I can set different instructions for each shape.
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Bild3.png" width="100%">
    If I use exactly the right color as the rectangles, the machine will recognize each different setting.

<table>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/WA2.jpeg" width="100%">
        <p>As you see all rectangle got cut out, so I could use the smallest Power of all three try-outs. (<u>Note:</u> before these 3 tests, I also tried out Power 40% - but it didn't went trough the whole material, so 50% should be fine!)
        </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Bild4.png" width="100%">
        <p>Now when I know which settings to use, I can place my Parametric shapes on the printing area.
        </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Parametric/Bild6.png" width="100%">
        <p>Because I know, that yellow has the right Speed and Power, I can just change the color of my shapes  in yellow and send it to the machine

<h2>Vinyl cutting</h2>
    <p>I wanted to design the backside of my ISP. It should contain my intial letters together with the FabAcademy logo. For that I used Illustrator and exported this image to a .dxf to silhouette.
    </p>

<ul>
    <h3>Modelling</h3>
  
<table>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/Screenshot1.png" width="80%">
    <p>I first grabbed the images (the png of the ISP, Logo and typed my letters as text). <br>
    I used the tool <code>Bildnachzeichner</code> to draw the grabbed images as well as the outter layer of the ISP.
    </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/Screenshot2.png" width="80%">
    <p>Than I simply exported it as a .dxf file.
    </p>
    </td>
</table>
<table>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/Screenshot3.png" width="80%">
    <p>In Silhouette it looks like that
    </p>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/Screenshot4.png" width="80%">
    <p>Scale everything to the size of the Microcontroller and go for it
    </p>
    </td>
</table>   
</ul>

<ul><h3>Cutting</h3>
    <table>
        <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/1.jpeg" width="80%">
            <p>With the blue rotary swivel you can change the grinding pressure of the knife. In my case I used 3 (that depends on the thickness and the consistency of the material)
            </p>        
        </td>
        <td valign="top"><img src="images/L4/Vinyl/2.jpeg" width="80%">
            <p>push the material in the aperture and press the key for collection. Now you can press send and the cutter will start.
            </p> 
        </td>
    </table>
</ul>
<ul>
    <h3>Final shot</h3>
    <img src="images/L4/Vinyl/3.jpeg" width="50%">
</ul>

<p><u>Note:</u> The Design of a Vinyl cuttet object is very limited in size (small objects). As you can see, the FabAcademy Logo is not properly cutted.</p>
