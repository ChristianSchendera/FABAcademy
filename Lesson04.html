    1. First build a rectangle and inserted 4 small rectangle on every side. Than trimmed the unneeded lines.
    
    4. Same with a triangular and a circle. For both I had to use small rectangles with fixation on 3 points to build it in a right angle and also trimmed out the unneeded lines.
    
    5. I used command in the scetchpallette to make all lines equal, so a bigger rectangle on one drawing will automatically change all others, too. In case i change the thickness of the material for example.
    
    v.s.
    
    6. Parameter approach
    here I can determine values for individual purposes. Just click on the + and type in the value and the name for it. In example "thickness".
    
    7. Now, when you press "D" or right click and press <code>Sketch measurement</code>, than you can define the size.
    
    8. Instead of typing numbers, you can now define by the specific name you gave to the value, like here "thickness"
    
    9. As you see, the thickness now changed to 5mm automatically.
    
    10. You can do that for every purpose you like. I also defined the length of the sides next to my cutoffs (10mm).
    
    11. Now if you use a different material it is easy to change the sizes of all drawings by simple using the parameter and changing the values as you like. I now wanted to have a 10mm thick material and the sidelength should be 40mm.
    
    Note:
Even if you use the parameter to define your values, it is inevitable to use the tool for making lines equal to each other. Or for the triangular to make the cut-off-lines coinzident to the outside-line.
