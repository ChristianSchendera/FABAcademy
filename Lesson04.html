                   <p>There is no specific project that is focussed on this very useful tool. There are a range of ways you might utilise it throughout the programme, or your local instructor may set a specific project. You might make:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>stickers</li>
                <li>flexible circuit boards</li>
                <li>a textured surface/relief pattern</li>
                <li>screenprint resists/stencils</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Ensure that you have used it in some way during this time and met the objectives below.</p>
